A simple Python library to play Yahtzee through the command line.

## Usage
In the terminal:
```bash
python3 yahtzee.py
```
### How to play:
When the game first launches, you'll be prompted to indicate how many players there will be, then you will be asked for their names.

## Work in Progress
Currently there needs to be improvements made to the error handling and input sanitization. Invalid selections will cause the program to crash.
